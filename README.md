# Texture Tweaks

**end of support on _january 31st_ 2025 and be archived. then the mod will be removed off modrinth _febuary 9_ and here the mod's workspace files were accidentally removed, so this mod cannot be updated further**

_Texture Tweaks_ is a mainly neoforge mod that changes _minecraft_'s textures by modifying them to look better.

Like the ping bars have colors now, the scrollers have arrows, and much more!
