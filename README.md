# Texture Tweaks

_Texture Tweaks_ is a mainly neoforge mod that changes _minecraft_'s textures by modifying them to look better.

Like the ping bars have colors now, (I hope. _can someone verify this in the here in the issues tab_?) the scrollers have arrows, and much more! 

But i'll make sure to keep everything looking vanilla and like its normal!
